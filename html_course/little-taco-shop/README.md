# "HTML Project for Beginners"

âœ… [Check out Dave Gray's YouTube Channel with all of mhisy tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

This repository shares the starter code for the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/T5PD8ofhiug).

**Challenge:** Utilizing the knowledge I have gained from the [HTML for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop.

**Directions:**

- There are images of the 3 web pages I need to build in the examples folder. I'll use them as references for what I build.

- I should name my files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. I need to link that file to my HTML files.

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If I need to find taco emojis, try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/).

- A favicon is already included. I'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
